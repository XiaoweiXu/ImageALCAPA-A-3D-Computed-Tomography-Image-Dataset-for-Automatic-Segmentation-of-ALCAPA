# ImageALCAPA-A-3D-Computed-Tomography-Image-Dataset-for-Automatic-Segmentation-of-ALCAPA

The ImageALCAPA dataset totally consists of 30 3D CTA images gathered from Guangdong Provincial Peoplesâ€™ Hospital from June 17, 2016, to August 8, 2021. 
These images are acquired by a SOMATOM Definition Flash CT machine.  
All the images are pre-operative ALCAPA CTA images whose top and bottom are around the neck and the brachiocephalic vessels, respectively, in the axial view. 
The segmentation labeling is performed by a team of two cardiovascular radiologists who have extensive experience in ALCAPA. 
For each image, one radiologist fulfills the labelling while the other verifies it afterwards.
The segmentation includes seven substructures: Myo, LV, RV, PA, Ao, LCA, and RCA, and the labelling of each 
image goes by 1-1.5 hours.
